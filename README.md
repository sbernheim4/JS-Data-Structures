# About

This repo contains implementations of various data structures all written in JS. I am using Facebooks Jest testing framework as well to write tests for the different data strutures I implement. All tests are in the tests folder. Any DS that have multiple components will be in their own folder. 

# Data Structures

- [x] Stack
- [x] Queue
- [x] Doubly Linked List
- [ ] Hashmap
- [ ] Binary Tree
